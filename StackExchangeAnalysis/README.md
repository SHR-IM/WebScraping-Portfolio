# StackExchange Analysis Project

This project involves scraping and analyzing data from the Politics subforum of StackExchange, a popular Q&A platform. The aim is to extract meaningful insights about user activity, tag usage, and engagement trends using web scraping and data analysis techniques.

## Project Overview
- **Objective**: Scrape and analyze questions, user data, and tag trends from the StackExchange Politics subforum.
- **Tools and Libraries**: 
  - Web scraping: `Scrapy`, `BeautifulSoup`
  - Data manipulation and visualization: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
  - Statistical analysis: `statsmodels`

## Features
1. **Web Scraping**:
   - Scrapes questions, user profiles, and tags from the subforum.
   - Handles navigation across multiple pages for comprehensive data collection.
2. **Data Analysis**:
   - Tag frequency analysis to identify popular topics.
   - User engagement analysis, including the impact of questions, answers, and comments on reputation.
   - Statistical modeling using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression.

## Folder Structure
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and visualization.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for web scraping and data cleaning.
- `data/`: Raw and cleaned datasets.
- `outputs/`: Graphs and summary tables from the analysis.

## Key Insights
- Questions contribute significantly to user reputation, as shown by regression analysis.
- Tags such as `united-states` and `donald-trump` dominate discussions.
- Users with high engagement in specific tags tend to have higher reputation scores.

## Future Work
- Expand the analysis to other subforums of StackExchange.
- Incorporate advanced machine learning techniques for predictive insights.
